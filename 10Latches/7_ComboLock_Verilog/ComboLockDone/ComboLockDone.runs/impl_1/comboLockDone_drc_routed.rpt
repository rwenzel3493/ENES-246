2. REPORT DETAILS

LUTLP-2#1 Warning
Combinatorial Loop Allowed  
45 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. This loop has been identified in the constraints as being known and understood by use of the ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS property on a net in the loop. The cells in the loop are: S_inferred__0_i_1, Y1_2xANDa_inferred__0_i_1, Y1_2xANDb_inferred__0_i_1, Y1_4xAND0_inferred__0_i_1, Y1_4xAND_inferred__0_i_1, Y1_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_3xANDa0_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_3xANDa_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_3xANDb0_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_3xANDb_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_3xANDc0_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_3xANDc_inferred__0_i_1, Y2_inferred__0_i_1, Y3_2xAND_inferred__0_i_1, Y3_inferred__0_i_1 (the first 15 of 45 listed).
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
1 out of 14 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: s[0].
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-3#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus s[1:0] are not locked:  s[0]
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
1 out of 14 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: s[0].
Related violations: <none>
