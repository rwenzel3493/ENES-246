CRITICAL WARNING: [Board 49-67] The board_part definition was not found for digilentinc.com:nexys4_ddr:part0:1.1. This can happen sometimes when you use custom board part. You can resolve this issue by setting 'board.repoPaths' parameter, pointing to the location of custom board files. Valid board_part values can be retrieved with the 'get_board_parts' Tcl command.

INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [D:/GitHub/ENES-246/10Latches/6_WobblyRingDelays/WobblyRing.srcs/constrs_1/imports/4_ComboLockASN/Nexys4DDR_Master.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/wobblyRing_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/wobblyRing_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
